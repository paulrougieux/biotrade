"""
Reallocate import quantities to the original country of production of a commodity.

For example if country A imports a commodity from country B and country B has
imported that commodity from country C. You don't want to attribute country A's
land footprint to country B. The purpose of this script is to reallocate A's
footprint to country C. It is done by first splitting the imported quantity
from B into a share produced in B and a share imported by B (from 0% to 100%).
Then the share imported by B is reallocated to all its import partners
according to the share of trade coming from those countries into B. Quantities
are expressed in weight equivalent of the primary commodity. The conversion to
a footprint in terms of area occurs at a later stage.

Example: see obs3df_methods trade_share_reallocation.py

TODO: hard code the conversion factors and value share for a small list of
      selected products and paste the example here.
